This Project has rest methods which performs points calculation based on purchase values. I have created various interfaces for each 
smaller modules. In order to have single responsibility for each method in a class.

 Though I have created different layers for like controller, repository, manager etc., Along with implemented a small in memory H2 database for data loading. I have 
created a sample Junit test cases as well.

Please run this project using maven spring-boot:run command. 

P.S The time 6 hours is not sufficient to setup a new project from scratch and give a 100% working code. I am looking for your feedbacks.
